# Project Specifications

In this file I want to write down my initial ideas for this pet project.

## Funtional Specifications
	
Now to the actual idea of the pet project:

1. As a user, I want to search for other programmers so that I can find a potential pair programming partner and get in contact with her.
2. As a user, I want to see other users with profile information about them in a list so that I can select one of these users, if I think he would be a interesting partner to pair programm with.
3. As a user, I want to be able to filter the list of users by their profile information so that I can search more precisely.
4. As a user, I want to have an own profile page so that other users can see my profile and some information about me.
5. As a user, I want to be able to display and edit the following information on my profile:
    - My username
    - A profile picture
    - The programming languages in which and thechnologies with wich I would like to pair programm
    - Code Katas or similar things I want to do in the pair programming session
    - If I want to pair programm remotely or locally
    - If remotely, my preferred video conference tools
    - If locally, the area to meet
    - The preferred times for the pair programming sessions
    - My contact details (Mail, Twitter, LinkedIn, WhatsApp, Discord, ...)
6. As a user, I want to recieve recomendations about other users, who would fit to my profile, so that I can find better pair programming partners in a simple way.

## Methodical Specifications

A requirement of the project is to use TDD.

## Technical Specifications

The following technologies will be used in my pet project:
- Frontend
  - [Angular](https://angular.io/)
  - [Jasmine](https://jasmine.github.io/) 
- Backend
  - [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot)
  - [JUnit5](https://junit.org/junit5/)
  - [Swagger](https://swagger.io/) (I think Swagger is a cool framework but I'm not sure, if I'll really use it, because there are many other new things to learn and this could be a burden at the moment)


## Further Ideas

Besides Pair Programming there exists Mob Programming, so why not expand my project with an option to search for groups to do Mob Programming together.
