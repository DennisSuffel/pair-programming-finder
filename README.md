## Introduction
This pet project aims to be a platform for developers, who want to find a partner for an online or local pair programming session.  
I think this is an interessting idea, especially with the current pandemic ongoing, where you can't just meet friends or colleagues in real life.
I don't expect this project to ever go live - it is just an nice idea I'm interested in. In other words it is just a means to an end to update my knowledge and strengthen my experience in software developing.

## Motivation
I feel like this project would not be a pet project, if there is not something new for me to learn by working on this project. The following two sections are my motivational reasons, why I'm doing this pet project.

### Angular and Spring Boot
I started this pet project, because I want to learn and get used to some more modern frontend and backend technologies.  
I know the classic Spring framework and am learning Angular at the moment, so I decided for Angular and Spring Boot as the main technologies of frontend and backend.
This way I can get more practice and deepen my knowledge in both of them.

### Test Driven Development
In Addition I want to get to know Test Driven Development (TDD) in practise and get used to the development cycle of TDD, by doing it in this pet project.
